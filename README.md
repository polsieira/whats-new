# What's New?

A project during my third module at Turing School of Software Design. For this project, I work on developing some muscle memory in building out simple React components and passing data down as props. The project aids on giving me an understanding of the difference between class components and function components and getting a sense of when to use one over the other. Goals of this project are:

* Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
* Learn to pass information between components using props.
* Learn to write readable JSX (your render methods/return statements should be clean and simple).
* Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
* Learn how to unit test React components including snapshot testing, methods, and changes in state.
